Heavily inspired from [UIKitDSL](https://github.com/mecid/UIKitSwiftDSL) but want some functionalities added.

Have you known [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko)? That's beauty of DSL as first class citizen.

## Dependency Management
### CocoaPod
ViewDSL available through CocoaPod! Yay!
```ruby
pod "ViewDSL"
```
### Carthage
```
github "muizidn/viewdsl"
```
## Constraint?
No, ViewDSL doesn't handle constraint for you. It let you choose any constraint approach avilable or using other 3rd party library.

## Base DSL

With ViewDSL you can build UI in declarative way.
```swift
UIView().add { (v: UIView) in
  
}
```
Unfortunately, ViewDSL force you to explicitly declare type of instance to be added. That isn't better from UIKitDSL. Agreed.

Lets take a look below example. ViewDSL give you functionality to initialize your UIView in some _fun_ way.
```swift
class EqualStackView: UIStackView {
  func layoutSubviews() {
    super.layoutSubviews()
    distribution = .fillEqually
    spacing = 10
  }
}

let stack = EqualStackView { s in
  s.axis = .vertical
  
  s.add { (s: EqualStackView) in
    s.axis = .horizontal
    
    s.add { (b: UIButton) in
      b.setTitle("Yes", for: .normal)
      b.backgroundColor = .green
    }
    s.add { (b: CustomButton) in
      b.title = "No"
      b.bgColor = .red
    }
  }
}
```
Thats the power from `ClosureInit`! But you must implement `init()` method in your custom class to get it's support.
Funny because all NSObject classes and its derived classes must have implentation of `init()` right? So UIView classes!

The way ViewDSL ask you to declare explicitly type of instance to be added gives you power to make all your custom classes works with ViewDSL out-of-the-box. But sure, you can make your custom function to make your DSL more like Anko or UIKitDSL.

```swift
extension ViewDSL {
  @discardableResult
  func stack(_ closure: (UIStackView) -> Void) -> UIStackView {
     return add { (s: UIStackView) in
       closure(s)
     }
  }
}
```

The [UIKitDSL's like implementation](UIKitDSL.swift) has been provided for you. But it doesn't included in library by default. You must manually copy-paste it to your application. All method prefixed with `u` to indicate it produces UIKit class instance.

## DelegatedDSL

You want to separate your common Button to reuse it later? Meet DelegatedDSL!

```swift
// Look Here I'm using my custom DSL from previous code
view.stack {
  $0.axis = .vertical
  
  // And I want to added by common button to current view
  $0.dsl(delegatedTo: blueButton(_:))
}

// I'm using function to put my common button implementation
func blueButton(_ dsl: ViewDSL) {
    dsl.add { (b: UIButton) in
        b.backgroundColor = .blue
    }
}
```

## LayoutBuilderDSL

This protocol will fit if you need complex UI implementation to be put in different file.
```swift
class ProfileLayout: LayoutBuilderDSL {
    let name: UITextField
    let email: UITextField
    let saveButton: UIButton

    init(name: String, email: String) {
        name = UITextField {
          $0.text = name
        }
        email = UITextField {
          $0.text = email
        }
        saveButton = UIButton {
          $0.setTitle("Save", for: .normal)
        }
    }

    func layout(_ dsl: ViewDSL) {
        dsl.add(name)
        dsl.add(email)
        dsl.add(saveButton)
    }
}

stack.dsl(delegatedTo: ProfileLayout(name: "Egg-boy", email: "eggboy@youknow.com"))
```
If you want to use `*.self` style, you can implement `InitializableLayoutBuilderDSL`
```swift
extension ProfileLayout2: ProfileLayout, InitializableLayoutBuilderDSL {
  init() {
    super.init(name: "", email: "")
  }
}

stack.dsl(withInstanceOf: ProfileLayout2.self)
```

Beautiful!!

And some you may find it in Example project! Have a try!

## Supporting 3rd Party Library

This Library [AloeStackView](https://github.com/airbnb/AloeStackView) mimics UIStackView with functionalities added. It is a subclass of UIScrollView which made default `ViewDSL.put(_:)` implementations for either UIView or UIStackView invalid. You should support it your self. Is it possible?

You may want to read this post before proceed [Override Protocol Extension Default Implementation in Swift](https://medium.com/@m.muizzsuddin_25037/override-protocol-extension-default-implementation-in-swift-969753f4b11b?fbclid=IwAR1RhhfHlsH3oMyP39cdai4_rt31Qh19EhzUpGY5RamAeQ9t_-GNUC004oM)

ViewDSL make use of Dynamic Dispatch to determine what implementation of `put(_:)` to be called. And because either the protocol and it requirement is an @objc then we can override `put(_:)` for our AloeStackView.

```swift
extension AloeStaskView {
  @objc
  public override put(_ view: UIView) {
    addRow(view, animated: true)
  }
}

view.add { (aloe: AloeStackView) in
  aloe.add { (b: UIButton) in
    b.setTitle("Click Me!", for: .normal)
  }
}
```
